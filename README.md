The game of Uno contains 108 cards varying between different colors of Red, Green, Blue and Yellow.

Each of these colors contains number cards and specialized cards, including the skip, reverse, and plus two cards. There are also wild cards and plus four wild cards that allow for the selection of any of the previously mentioned colors. 

The goal of the game is to be the first to place all of the cards in your deck. 

Your deck is visually represented at the bottom of the screen, only showing 6 cards in your hand at a time. To see the other cards, a scroll bar is above your deck that can be moved to reveal the other cards in your deck.

To place a card, you need to click on the card in your deck and then click on the top card of the pile. If you don’t have any available cards, you need to click on the Uno card to the left of the pile to draw a card. 

When you have placed your second to last card, you have 5 seconds before the computer makes it’s turn to click the Uno play button to say uno or you will receive a two card penalty.
